I hit the ball over the net, just in the right spot for the ball to hit the water. We scored a point. It was my turn to serve. I tossed the ball up into the air, and hit it well over the net.
The entire basketball team was celebrating a huge win by quite ironically playing volleyball. Emma hit the ball to Marcus, who then hit the ball to Bryce, who then hit the ball right into the net. Both teams were now tied 25 to 25. I don't remember much of the game, though my team lost, but by a small margin - 33 to 35.
"Hey James, can you fill in for me; I need to do something" I told James sitting on the side of the pool, spectating the game. He jumped in and took my place. "Someone fill in for me too, I gotta pee." Kyle broadcasted. I swam to the side of the pool facing my house, and pushed myself out. I dried myself off, went upstairs to my room, turned on the lights, and shut the door. A minute later, someone knocked on my shut door. Nobody came in, so it definitely wasn't one of my parents.
I opened the door to Kyle. "Can I come in?" he shyly asked. "Sure?.. How come?" I confusingly asked. "No reason," He responded, "I just wanna talk to you." He walked into my room and sat down at the small table near the wall adjoining the one with the door. "You have a big house." Kyle commented. He had been to my house twice before, so it was obvious he was just making small talk, but I decided to do some too: "Not really, my parents have a big house, I just live here." Kyle made a face that showed mild approval.
I sat sideways at the chair on the other side of the table. "What do you want to talk to me about?" Kyle seemed to forget what he was here for, and took a few seconds thinking. "Oh, just random things, I haven't gotten to know you very well; no offense but, you're kinda shy." I turned to sit  straight on the chair "Really?" I asked, while tilting my head slightly. He seemed to think that I was offended. I was just pretending to be. "Oh, sorry." He apologized "Oh, its fine." I assured.
We sat in acutely awkward silence for a few seconds, then Kyle asked: "Do you have a girlfriend?" I started to wonder why he wanted to talk to me. He said that he wanted to get to know me better, but that question was just downright awkward. "No," I answered, "Why do you ask?". Kyle shook his head slightly. "No reason really. It's just that you're kinda the biggest, most popular jock in the entire school, and you're really a nerd. It's kind of off-putting."
"Well, you're not wrong, and I've tried to get a significant other, I just have a very constraining type."
"What's that type? I know a lot of people, I can help you out."
"Dudes." I looked at him like he was stupid.
Kyle looked slightly up at me during a three-second pause for him to register what I said. "Oh, you're gay..." He slowly stated, "That makes sense." In these types of situations, it gets very awkward, but I've found the best sentence to stop that:  "Yeah, you didn't know this?" I said while quickly shaking my head. "Fucking nobody does," His tone got more annoyed. "everyone instantly assume that every jock is a douchebag that wants nothing but praise and women. It's stupid."
"Do you have a girlfriend?" I asked to fail at changing the subject "Yeah, I've been dating Samantha for six months." He answered. Talking about girls is not my realm, but I can pretend, "I'm jealous, she's hot." I answered. "Yeah." Kyle sighed.
"Have you ever had sex?"
Oh fuck, that was the wrong thing to ask.
"Yeah…" He answered "Who on the team hasn't?"
"Me."
"Oh. Would you want to if you could?"
"Of course. Why wouldn't I want to?"
"Some people still don't do sex before marriage, or at all really." I shrugged, "Who have you had sex with?" I failed the fourth time to change the subject. "My girlfriend. And like, nine times."
"Wow, okay. Do you like it?"
"Yeah…"
We stared at each other for a solid ten seconds before Kyle finally said something: "What would you think about having sex?"
"Not much. It's entirely natural to want to do, and is completely safe if you take caution."
"That's not what I meant, what would you think about having sex with me?"
I involuntary blushed. "wait, WHAT?"
"I'm serious," A few silent seconds followed "We're alone, it's a big house, nobody will know. Also, I'm kinda curious what being on the bottom is like..."
"Seriously?"
"Yeah, why not really?" he shrugged.
"Well for starters, you would be cheating on your girlfriend, and it would be kind of weird."
"Well yeah," He said, "Actually I have no way to refute that. You wouldn't tell her right?"
"No"
"And you want to do it?"
"Yeah, I guess."
"Then let's do it."
We both got up, and went over to the most obvious place to do it: my bed and laid down on it. "Where do we start?" I asked, "I guess we take off our swimsuits, cuddle, and go from there." Kyle suggested, "No," I counteracted, "we should cuddle in our swimsuits." he agreed with a quick, "Sure."
I took the liberty of starting by facing him and putting my right arm on his left shoulder. He put his left hand on my waist. We were slow to start, but we started to reach around each other. Withing thirty seconds we had no distance between us.
We kissed each other, over and over. His skin was so smooth, his lips were intoxicating to the point where I almost couldn't feel anything. I slowly got numb to the mental feeling, and involuntarily started to think about how I got here. It all happened so quickly. Just ten minutes before, he was pounding my ass in volleyball, now I'm about to pound his ass. For years I had never gotten any boys to like me, but now suddenly I made it to second base in five minutes.
My hands made their way down to Kyle's ass. It was round, and firm. It was really firm. I spend about ten seconds before moving back up to the top of his swimsuit. I put my hand down his trunks. and rested my hands on the side of his butt cheeks. Kyle put his thumbs under my swimsuit and took them off me; I quickly did the same. We came up for air as I lifted him on top of me. 
We both paused.We stared at each other for a good ten seconds to process what just happened. "Are you sure you want to do this?" I asked. "Of course I want to, why wouldn't I?" I was quite suspicious at this point as to why he was being so nice to me, "Okay, if you want to stop at any point just tell me to stop or push me a bit." "Okay"
Kyle laid himself down on my chest, and kissed me again. I put my right hand on his lower back, and my left on his left butt cheek; he put his hands behind my back, just below the shoulder blades. We kissed again for about ten seconds, then we turned so that I was on the left side of the bed. He grabbed my 5" erect penis, and started to lightly jerk me off, I did the same to his.
After about thirty seconds Kyle stopped and said: "I think we should start now. Are you ready for this?" "Ready for what?" I asked. "Fucking me…" he said back "Oh right, yeah. I'm ready." I quickly answered
He got down on all fours and faced the head of my bed. I stared at him. I almost couldn't do it. He was so fucking hot; two feet away from me, naked, waiting for me to fuck him. It was all so sudden - he just came into my room and asked if I wanted to have sex with him. But still my primal urge took over my logic. I got behind him, and stared at him. "Having second regrets? You don't have to do this if you don't want to." "No, sorry. I'm just… Never mind" I got behind him and admired his butt before I slowly slid myself into him. He sighed a bit when I finished.
I started to slowly go in and out. I sped up. I placed my hands on the upper part of his butt, and wrapped them around the side. Kyle grabbed his dick and started to beat off. It felt amazing. The physical sensation was near-nothing, but the emotional sensation was a hundred times better than I had ever felt. I felt my orgasm coming, I could tell his was too.
I suddenly felt shame for a millisecond, or less. There wasn't a duration, it all just happened and ended instantly. I felt like I had forgotten my place. I felt like I forced myself onto him. I felt like I had let my parents down. I felt regret for existing. I continued to go in and out of him. I moved his waist slightly towards me when mine was moving towards him, and vice versa.
"What the fuck is happening?" I thought, "This isn't right, this is not supposed to be happening. Why did he-
I orgasmed. He did a few seconds after. We still continued our motions. I sighed for a few seconds, he did a bit later than me. I cummed, not much more than I had done before; he did to, of course all over my bed.
I pulled myself out of him and laid on the right side of the bed, he lied on the left. We were both breathing heavily. "So how was that?" I asked. "Not bad. Ten times better than just jerking off." He stopped to breathe a little more,
"Do you like me?" I knew the answer, but pretended to think about it, "A little bit. I didn't know you had a girlfriend though, sorry." "Oh, I don't mind." We looked each other in the eyes and smiled at each other, "Are you gay?" I asked.
"I don't think so, I'm probably straight." "Why did you want to have sex with me then?" Kyle looked up at the ceiling. "You know, I don't really know. I think I was just really horny. I'm really progressive, so me having sex with a guy isn't as weird as it is to most guys. But I'm straight."
I got up and went over to the wall opposite of my bed, and got two beer bottles from the small refrigerator just beside my desk. "You keep alcohol in your room?" Kyle asked while getting up. "Oh fuck, that hurts." "Oh yeah, that happens if someone with a giant penis screws you." He looked at me and smiled, "Fuck you." "You just did." "I walked right into that one."
I set two towels on the same chairs at we sat did before. We both sat down and took the tops off our beers. "Alcohol is great after sex," Kyle stated, "but you wouldn't know that." I looked out the window to see the rest of my team finishing up another game of volleyball. "Why are we playing volleyball?" I asked. "I actually don't know. We just started playing." I continued looking out the window. Marcus set the ball to Ayala, who hit the ball over to Kyle.
"What do we do now?" I asked. He took another sip of his beer. "I don't know, what do you want to do?" "We could sit here in talk," I suggested, "Maybe put some clothes on, or put my bedspread in the laundry." "Oh, sorry about that. I wasn't really thinking." He was looking slightly down, almost in shame. "Oh it's fine, I'm probably just angry because of post orgasm regret."
"What's post orgasm regret?" He asked, looking to change the subject. "It's where after a man orgasms, he feels shame, regret, and a whole horde of bad emotions in my experience." I am too much of a nerd, especially as a basketball player. "It that what I'm feeling?" "I don't really know, I can't tell, but probably. Kyle nodded slightly, "Let's get clothes on."
I got up and walked over to my swimsuit, picked it up, and got it on. I looked over at Kyle, he was still nude. I admired him before he put his suit on a few seconds later. I walked over to the table, grabbed my beer, and looked out the window. Kyle joined me. By this time, the team had started a second game without us. Kyle was kicking ass like he was to me before he joined me up in my room. "You're a surprisingly good volleyball player." Kyle looked at me and gave me a small smile, "Thank you." "You're welcome."
